HTML Forms

This project aims to be training in the way we use HTML forms to collect data from the users through the web

our goal is to give an answer to each of these questions



    Why are forms probably the most important part of your site?
    How do you construct a basic form?
    How do you specify which path the form gets submitted to?
    What are all the possible form element types?
    When should you use checkboxes instead of radio buttons?
    When should you use a combobox/dropdown instead of a text field?
    How do you make a very large text field?
    How do you link elements with their labels?
    How do you link element selections together (e.g. check boxes) so they are nicely formatted when your server receives them?
    What should your “submit” button probably say instead of “submit”?
